# Nélü ✨

I build thoughtful software.  
Turning chaos into clean, scalable systems people enjoy.

Software, for me, is not just code — it’s a way of thinking.

I care deeply about:
- 🧠 Architecture and long-term design
- 🧪 Testing, correctness and clarity
- 🧩 Complex domains made simple
- 🎨 UX in systems that usually ignore it
- 🤖 AI as craft, not as shortcut

I enjoy building things that:
- Stay understandable after years
- Feel calm to work with
- Respect the human on the other side
